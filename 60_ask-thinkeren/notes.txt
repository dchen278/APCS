DISCO:
- Outsourcing work is good. Give work to other people to do it, who then also give the work to others. Should eventually come back to you.  
- Split the array until each subarray has 1 element only
- Merge with other subarrays after the array is split properly. Until one array is left. Same size as the original.
- Don't bottleneck. Do work when subarrays are smaller.

QCC:
- Algo appears to be a job for recursion.
- Recursive method would involve two temp arrays

THINKER FIRMWARE:
1) Give: When > 1 card. Split deck in half and give to 2 other thinkeren. 
2) Take: Receive cards if hands are empty
3) Give (season 2): When == 1 card. Return card to whence it came. Ordered this time(?)
