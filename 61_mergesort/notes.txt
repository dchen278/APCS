DISCO:
- An array has to be sorted if there is only one element in the array!
- Outsourcing work is good. Give work to other people to do it, who then also give the work to others. Should eventually come back to you.
- Sort is a job for recursion and is much easier than trying to do it iteratively

QCC:
- How do you diagram sort()? merge only takes 2 inputs, but does each input have multiple return values?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
- When a thinker has >1 card, split the deck in half and give one each to two other thinkeren. Signal that your hands are empty.
- If a thinker's hands are empty and has not gotten a deck yet, receive a split deck from another thinker.
- If a thinker has 1 card, it is declared sorted. Return the card to the thinker who originally gave it to you.
- When you receive 2 decks of cards, place them both face up. Compare the face up cards and place the lowest card in a new pile
- When you have merged the 2 decks into 1, return it to the thinker who originally gave it to you
