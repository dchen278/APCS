1a. public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b. Yes it does require a parameter of type String. If you pass
    an argument of different type, it will result in a compile-time 
    error
1c. Yes, the method returns a double. 

2. 
    Abandoned: -0.09
    Editorial: -0.68
    sad: -1.37

3a. Would compile because the parameter type is correct and the return types match
3b. Would not compile because the parameter type is not correct and varType is different from return type
3c. Would not compile because the method only takes 1 parameter, but two is provided
