I was there yesterday waited 20 minutes order a caramel macchiato to receive a latte that was nasty non flavor taste like milk I don’t know what happen to Starbucks they don’t make lattes good anymore. Specially this one, I will never order from any Starbucks in my life again, I will stay faithful to Dunkin’ Donuts, they know how to make a good latte, they lost me for good
