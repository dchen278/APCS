## Experience
We thoroughly enjoyed doing this lab. It was much shorter and more clear than the previous lab. We managed our time very well, making great use of the time we had in class to work on this! Although we also did have a blip with the sinbad classpath, we were able to compile and run the code fairly quickly thanks to the help of the great thinkeren of the QAF. We also quite enjoyed the opportunity to take one of our own interests and integrate it into the world of CS, it was truly a enlightening experience.
