ThinkJava Notes

Three Main Types of Errors
    - Compile time errors indicate syntax errors (ex. missing parenthesis)
    - Runtime errors - errors that occur during runtime (ex. infinite recursion)
    - Logic Errors - the code is not doing what you meant it to doing

Compile-time Errors
    - Always use incremental development
    - Only the first error message is truly reliable
    - Read errors carefully and make sure the code is formatted properly
        - Check that all parenthesis are balanced
        - And check for any other common syntax errors
    - If you can't see the error that the compiler is referring to, make sure
    that it is the same version
        - Make a copy of the file(ex. make a copy called {FILENAME}.old)
    - Don't always listen to what the compiler is telling you to do

Runtime Errors
    - If the program is "hanging", then it is probably in an infinite loop/recursion
        - Try adding print statements that indicate entering and exiting the loop
        - Most of the time infinite recursion will cause a StackOverflowError
    - Always check if there's base case
    - Add print statements to see the flow of the execution
    - Exception Errors
        - Examine the line in the code and check if the variable is null or if the 
        index is out of bounds, etc
    - Try simplifying print statements

Logic Errors
    - Try summoning a mental image of the code and what it's supposed to do
        - KtS are also very helpful!
    - Use == to check if objects are identical and .equals to check for equivalence
    - Split complex expressions into variables
    - If you are really stuck, try getting away from the computer for a few minutes
        - Bring someone else in to look at your code
    - Keep in mind even the best programmers get stuck
    - If you found the bug, take a min to see waht caused the bug and how you could have 
    found it faster
