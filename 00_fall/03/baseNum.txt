0. The base is the available amount of digits in a counting system. Examples: Binary uses 2 digits, 1 and 0; base 10 or decimal uses 10 digits, 0-9; and base 16 or hexadecimal uses 0-9 and A-F.

1. Binary is the base 2 counting system. We care because the system is simpler to work with and uses less time and memory than counting systems with larger bases.

2. 
  1. List powers of 2 for all the digits starting from the right.
  2. Starting from the right, multiply the number by its respective power of 2.
  3. Find the sum of all the products.
  
  Example: 100 to decimal
  
  0 -> 0 * 2^0 = 0
  0 -> 0 * 2^1 = 0
  1 -> 1 * 2^2 = 4
          sum -> 4
          
  Answer = 4
  
3.
  1. Divide # by 2
  2. Use integer quotient for next cycle
  3. Use remainder for binary digit starting from the right or end of the binary number.
  4. Repeat until quotient equals 0


Example: 4 to binary 

     Quotient Remainder
4/2 |   2    |   0
    |        |
2/2 |   1    |   0
    |        |
1/2 |   0    |   1


Answer = 100
