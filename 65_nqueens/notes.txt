HW65: How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Place Queens...
2022-02-16w
time spent: 1 hr 

DISCO:
- Algo utilizes recursive backtracking.
- Board sizes of 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 cannot be solved in such a way that n queens may be placed without attacking each other.
- For board sizes of 1 x 1 and anything 4 x 4 or higher, there is a solution(s) to placing n queens so that they could not attack each other.

QCC:
- Would a board size of 0 x 0 be considered "solveable"?
- How many solutions are possible to a given n x n board? Is there a pattern?
